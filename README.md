# Iris_dataset
In this project, I implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify Iris flower species based on their morphological features. The Iris dataset, a classic in machine learning, comprises 150 samples across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, each described by four featuresâ€”sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
I began by loading the dataset using scikit-learn's load_iris() function. To prepare the data for modeling, I split it into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio using train_test_split. Recognizing the importance of feature scaling in distance-based algorithms like KNN, I normalized the features using StandardScaler to ensure each feature contributed equally to the distance computations.
For model training, I utilized scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier. I experimented with different values of K to determine the optimal number of neighbors, evaluating each model's performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices. This experimentation helped in understanding the bias-variance trade-off associated with different K values.
To visualize the classifier's decision boundaries, I focused on the first two features for a two-dimensional representation. By creating a mesh grid and predicting the class for each point, I plotted the decision regions, using distinct colors to represent different classes. This visualization provided an intuitive understanding of how the KNN algorithm partitions the feature space and classifies new data points based on proximity to existing labeled samples.
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with the KNN algorithm, emphasizing the significance of data preprocessing, parameter tuning, and visualization in building effective classification models. The project not only reinforced theoretical concepts but also highlighted practical considerations in machine learning workflows.
